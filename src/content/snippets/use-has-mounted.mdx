### Why

When dealing with a server-side rendered application (through frameworks like Gatsby or Next, or any sort of SSR setup), it can be useful to know whether you're rendering on the server or the client.

The trick here is that `useEffect` only triggers on the client side _inside_ the browser. Smart right?

### Usage

<CodeBlock>

```js title="hookExample.js"
const hasMounted = useHasMounted()

if (hasMounted) {
  // do stuff
}
```

</CodeBlock>

### Code

<CodeBlock>

```js title="useHasMounted.js"
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export const useHasMounted = () => {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false)
  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true)
  }, [])

  return hasMounted
}
```

</CodeBlock>
