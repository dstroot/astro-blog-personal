  "comments": "The authorship of this quote is somewhat disputed, and Ann Landers credits Derek Bok, president of Harvard University. In any case I love the succinct twist on the value of education and the cost of ignorance. I hope we can improve the quality of our schools and access to education for everyone - it is so fundamental to our future."
